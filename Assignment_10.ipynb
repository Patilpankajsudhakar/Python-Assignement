    "1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Shutil module in Python provides many functions of high-level operations on files and collections of files. It comes under Python’s standard utility modules. This module helps in automating process of copying and removal of files and directories\n",
    "1)Shutil.copy() method in Python is used to copy the content of source file to destination file or directory. It also preserves the file’s permission mode but other metadata of the file like the file’s creation and modification times is not preserved. \n",
    "2)shutil.copytree() method recursively copies an entire directory tree rooted at source (src) to the destination directory."
