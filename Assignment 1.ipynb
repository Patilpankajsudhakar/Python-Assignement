    "A variable are symbols that you can use to store data in a program. we store the any type of observation in one variabe for example int, string, float etc with help of list, tuple or dict.\n",

    " Answer:- \n",
    " 1) Intger (int): interges are zero, postive or negative whole number without a fractional part and having unlimited precision.\n",
    "    eg. 0, 50, -6. integers are binary, octal, hexadeciamal values eg. 0b11, 0o13, 0x13 respectively. use int() function to         convert float, string to int. everty strint is not convert to int, example: 'ram' is not convert to int beacause in not         number only number in from of string are convert to int example: \"10\".\n",
    "                 \n",
    " 2) Float: floating numbers are postive and negative ral numbers with a fractional part. eg. 24.5, -5.2,\n",
    "    floats can be separated by underscore _  is a valid float. use float() funcation to convert string or int to float.\n",
    "    similary as above every string is not convert in float.\n",
    "    \n",
    " 3) String: string is immutable sequence of data type. it is the sequence of unicode characters wrapped inside single,double or triple codes.\n",
    " eg: 'Hello world', \"Hello world\", ''' Hello world'''\n",

    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do? \n",
    "Answer:\n",
    " An expression is made of combination operaters and operands that is interpreted to produce some other values.\n",
    " following are the type of expression\n",
    " 1) Constant expressions: it consists of only constant values. A Constant value is one that doesn't change eg. 5, 'y'.\n",
    " 2) Integral expressions: those which produce integer results after implementing all the automatic and explicit type conversions. eg. x,y,x/y where x and y are integer variables.\n",
    " 3) Floating expressions: Float expressions are which produce floating point results after implementing all the automatic and explicit type conversions. eg 10.75 5.2\n",
    " 4) Relational expressions: Relational Expressions yield results of type bool which takes a value true or false. When arithmetic expressions are used on either side of a relational operator, they will be evaluated first and then the results compared. Relational expressions are also known as Boolean expressions. Eg x==y, x<y, x>y, X>=y, x<=y\n",
    " 5) Logical expressions: it combine two or more relational expressions and produces bool type results. eg. x==y && x>y, x!=0, x||y.\n",
    " 6) Bitwise expressions: it used to manipulate data at bit level. They are basically used for testing or shifting bits. "

    "5.This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an\n",
    "expression and a statement?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "1)Expression: An Expression is a sequence or combination of values, variables, operators and function calls that always produces or returns a result value. eg: x = 5, y = 3, z = x + y\n",
    "  The evaluation of an expression does not changes state and produces at least one value as a result.\n",
