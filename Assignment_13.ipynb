    "1. What advantages do Excel spreadsheets have over CSV spreadsheets?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    While Excel (XLS and XLSX) file formats are better for storing more complex data, CSV files are supported by nearly all data upload interfaces. If you are planning to move your data between platforms, export and import it from one interface to another, you might be better off with the CSV file format."

    "2.What do you pass to csv.reader() and csv.writer() to create reader and writer objects?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    To read a CSV file in Python, we can use the csv.reader() function. Suppose we have a csv file named people.csv in the current directory with the following entries.\n",
    "Ex:\n",
    "    import csv\n",
    "    with open('people.csv', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    reader = csv.reader(file)\n",
    "    for row in reader:\n",

    "\n",
    "To write to a CSV file in Python, we can use the csv.writer() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The csv.writer() function returns a writer object that converts the user's data into a delimited string. This string can later be used to write into CSV files using the writerow() function. \n",

    "    import csv\n",
    "with open('protagonist.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:\n",
    "    writer = csv.writer(file)\n",
    "    writer.writerow([\"SN\", \"Movie\", \"Protagonist\"])\n",

    "    ‘r’\tOpen a file for reading. (default)\n",
    "    ‘w’\tOpen a file for writing. Creates a new file if it does not exist or truncates the file if it exists.\n",

    "    ‘a’\tOpen for appending at the end of the file without truncating it. Creates a new file if it does not exist.\n",
    "    ‘t’\tOpen in text mode. (default)\n",
